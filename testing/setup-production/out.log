number of accepted transfer moves was [ 0.6288]
ordered mols for calculating swaps is ['1 H2', '2 CH4']
predicted probability too high, setting maxProb = 0.6000
actual accepted swaps per cycle will be 0.6289 (we arent doing swatches)
{'1 H2': {'12': 1.0, 'total': 1.0}, '2 CH4': {'total': 0.0}}
pmcb was zero previously, keeping it that way
